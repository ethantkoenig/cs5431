\section{Sprint Report}

\subsection{Activity Breakdown}

\begin{enumerate} % TODO update
\item Ethan worked on client-side generation of keys, switching to a single master password, improved account unlocking, cryptocurrency bug fixes, and UI improvements. He contributed 50 hours to this sprint.
\item Will implemented and tested two-factor authentication for adding keys. He also assisted with manual testing of the web app, and contributed roughly 25 hours to the final sprint.
\item Evan focused on usbaility, ensuring that the web app responds with proper success/error messages and that the UI is functional and intuitive. Evan contributed roughly 10 hours to this sprint.
\item James worked on giving non-mining nodes the ability to maintain a blockchain, making the webserver a node, and the requests and response from nodes for determining funds for a given key.
  He also worked on manually testing the system.
  James contributed approximately 15 hours to this sprint.
\item Eric worked on documentation and user testing.
He contributed approximately 8 hours to this sprint.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Productivity Analysis}

Our goals for this sprint were the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add requests, and the ability to accept/decline requests.
\item Improved audit and logging for the web app.
\item Allow for client-side generation of keys, so that users of the webapp can create a new key without having to use our text-based client.
\item Use a single master password, from which different authenication and encryption secrets are derived
\item Use two-factor authorization for key upload.
\item Separate the password reset and account unlocking workflows, so that a user's keys are not cleared if the user's account becomes locked.
\item Make improvement to the web app's UI.
\item Improve the command-line interface for running our project.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\noindent We were able to accomplish all of our goals for this sprint.
