\section{Sprint Report}

\subsection{Activity Breakdown}

\begin{enumerate} % TODO update
\item Ethan worked on client-side generation of keys, switching to a single master password, improved account unlocking, cryptocurrency bug fixes, and UI improvements. He contributed 50 hours to this sprint.
\item Will implemented and tested the server backend required to display amounts by processing the UTXO set. He also worked on testing the web app. He contributed 20 hours to this sprint.
\item Evan implemented the password recovery feature, the friends feature, the account lockout feature, relocated the database to a remote location, and assisted with UI and error handling. The friend feature allows users to only receive money from those who they have previously identified as a "friend." Evan contributed roughly 30 hours to this sprint.
\item James worked on giving non-mining nodes the ability to maintain a blockchain, making the webserver a node, and the requests and response from nodes for determining funds for a given key.
  He also worked on manually testing the system.
  James contributed approximately 15 hours to this sprint.
\item Eric worked on networking, adding message types and appropriate handling.
He also worked on some of the functionality needed by the server to create transactions and query for the total amount owned by a public key.
Eric contributed approximately 12 hours to this sprint.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Productivity Analysis}

Our goals for this sprint were the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add requests, and the ability to accept/decline requests.
\item Improved audit and logging for the web app.
\item Allow for client-side generation of keys, so that users of the webapp can create a new key without having to use our text-based client.
\item Use a single master password, from which different authenication and encryption secrets are derived
\item Use two-factor authorization for key upload.
\item Separate the password reset and account unlocking workflows, so that a user's keys are not cleared if the user's account becomes locked.
\item Make improvement to the web app's UI.
\item Improve the command-line interface for running our project.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\noindent We were able to accomplish all of our goals for this sprint.
